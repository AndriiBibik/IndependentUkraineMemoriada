        Thank You for supporting Ukrainian people in its will to stay alive.
        Later, after we\'ll stop the aggression, welcome visiting Ukraine (if you are a foreigner)
        All the money made from this Memoriada game I will appoint to help Ukrainian army or civilians suffered.
        As far as possible I will try to publish confirmation of my help on the \"Google Play Apps for You\" Facebook page.
